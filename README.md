# ESP32 MKZ4
Customized MKZ4 Firmware for ESP32 (**NOT** for ESP8266).  
This is based on `cerevo/MKZ4`, but I re-built it using nearly a discrete setup.

*My machine works by these codes for now, but I don't expect them to work universally for all your DIY products, so I recommend customizing them as you like.
